    <p>Light and fluffy blueberry muffins<br></p>
    <h4>Ingredients (Makes about 10 muffins)</h4>
    <ul>
        Muffins:
        <li>240 g plain flour</li>
        <li>130 g sugar</li>
        <li>8 g baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>300 g plant based yogurt</li>
        <li>80 ml neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>150 to 200 g blueberries (fresh or frozen)</li><br>
        Crumble:
        <li>40 g plain flour</li>
        <li>25 g raw sugar</li>
        <li>25 g margarine</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the flour and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Add the margarine then knead the mixture between your fingers until you obtain a sandy dough that crumbles.</li>
        <li>Place in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C</li>
        <li>In a bowl mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the yogurt, oil and vanilla extract then mix quickly without overworking the dough.</li>
        <li>Add the blueberries (keep a small part in order to place them on the surface of the muffins afterwards) then mix gently with the spatula, taking care not to crush the blueberries.</li>
        <li>Place paper liners in the indentations of a muffin tin and pour the batter to fill them 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining blueberries to the surface of the muffins then sprinkle with the crumble.</li>
        <li>Bake for 5 minutes at 220°C then lower the temperature to 180°C and continue cooking for 20 to 30 minutes (time varies depending on the oven, watch closely).</li>
        <li>The muffins are ready when they are lightly browned, well puffed, and the blade of a knife comes out dry when you stick it inside the muffins.</li>
        <li>If using frozen blueberries, let them thaw slightly before using (otherwise they will release too much water and may alter the texture of the muffins).</li>
